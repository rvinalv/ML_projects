* Use machine learning techniques to design and optimize molecular models with desired thermodynamic properties. You can explore the use models to generate novel molecular structures with specific properties, or use regression models to predict the properties of existing molecules based on their structure.

* Develop a machine learning model to predict protein stability based on thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs energy and enthalpy. You can train the model using a dataset of known protein structures and experimentally determined
